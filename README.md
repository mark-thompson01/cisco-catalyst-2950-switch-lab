# 🖧 Cisco Catalyst 2950 Switch Lab

This repository contains my **hands-on lab using a Cisco Catalyst 2950 switch**, demonstrating foundational switch management and configuration skills.  
The Cisco Catalyst 2950 is an older managed switch, but it remains a great tool for practicing networking fundamentals.
